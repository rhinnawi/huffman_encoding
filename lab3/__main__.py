__main__

This is the entry point for the huffman_encoding package. It runs when explicity 
called and not by default when the package is imported. It can be called by the
command: python -m huffman_encoding input_file output_file [--debug]

The primary functionality lies in the package modules, and not directly in the
main module here.
