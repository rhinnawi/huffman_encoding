performance

This module holds a class that tracks metrics and performance. It allows for
maintaining a timer for runtime, storing size of a process (user's discretion),
and tracking previous successes' and errors' sizes and runtimes. Methods that 
would otherwise return None instead return current instance to allow for method
chaining.
